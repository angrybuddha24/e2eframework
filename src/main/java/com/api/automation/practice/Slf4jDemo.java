         * Logging Framework Overview
         * A logging framework usually contains three elements âˆ’
         * 
         * Logger
         * Captures the message along with the metadata.
         * 
         * Formatter
         * Formats the messages captured by the logger.
         * 
         * Handler
         * The Handler or appender finally dispatches the messages either by printing on
         * the console or, by storing in the database or, by sending through an email.
         * 
         * Some frameworks combine the logger and appender elements to speed up the
         * operations.
         */

        /*
         * Logger Object
         * To log a message, the application sends a logger object (sometimes along with
         * the exceptions if any) with name and security level.
         */

        /*
         * Logger Interface

     * in Java similar to log4J. Therefore, you cannot compare both. However, it is

     * If you have a choice, logging abstraction is always preferable than logging
     * framework. If you use a logging abstraction, SLF4J in particular, you can
     * migrate to any logging framework you need at the time of deployment without
     * opting for single dependency.
